Hello! I'm Aakash, a software engineer based in Dublin, Ireland, who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern back-ends.

Shortly after graduating from [Maharishi Markandeshwar University](https://www.mmumullana.org/), I joined the engineering team at [Kony](https://www.kony.com/) where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis. Then, I joined R & D team at [Samsung R & D](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), where I researched about Javascript Offloading and AI Editor. Later on, I moved to my hometown Gurugram and joined development team at [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/).

Recently, I shifted to Dublin and Joined [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) as Product Engineer 2.
