Hello! I'm Aakash, a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) based in Dublin, Ireland. I focus on enhancing the website platform by developing a Component Development Kit, empowering users with seamless and scalable solutions. My expertise in frontend technologies ensures a dynamic and efficient platform experience.

**I'm currently open to exciting opportunities in Gurugram, India**, where I previously worked with BlueStacks and am looking to return.

As an **Extension Developer for Chrome & Mozilla**, I've created browser tools that enhance developer productivity. I'm also passionate about **teaching and mentoring** - I've tutored over 300 students in competitive programming at Coding Ninjas, helping them improve their coding skills and land their dream jobs.

Previously, at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) as a Product Engineer 3, I played a key role in optimizing the onboarding process, leading to a **20% increase in user activation rates**. My contributions to features like AI Chatbot and Helpdesk significantly boosted the paid customer base by **12%**, and our team collectively onboarded **1,000+ new logos per month**.

Before moving to Dublin, I worked with [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) in Gurugram, developing authentication systems handling **1M daily token exchanges**. At [Samsung R&D](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), I researched and developed an AI Editor that reduced development costs by **80%** and created a JavaScript offloading utility that cut computation load by **50%**.

I'm an active open-source contributor with **119+ public repositories** on GitHub, **35+ followers**, and a passion for building tools that developers love. I've created browser extensions for Chrome and Mozilla, contributed to various awesome lists, and built educational resources that help developers learn and grow.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from [Maharishi Markandeshwar University](https://www.mmumullana.org/), and began my career at [Kony](https://www.kony.com/), where I worked on diverse projects improving CI/CD pipelines and building scalable marketplace platforms.

**Coder by Heart** ❤️ - I'm passionate about scalable architectures, user-centric solutions, and driving innovation through impactful digital experiences.
