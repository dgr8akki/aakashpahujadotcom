Hello! I'm Aakash, a software engineer based in Bangalore, IN who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern back-ends.

Shortly after graduating from [Maharishi Markandeshwar University](https://www.mmumullana.org/), I joined the engineering team at [Kony](https://www.kony.com/) where I work on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

Recently, I joined R & D team at [Samsung R & D](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b).
